              The three founders joined forces to accelerate gender smart
              investment in women in agri-value chains. Driven by their passion
              for ‘problem solving’ and with their complimentary professional
              backgrounds and experience with the public and private sector in
              Europe and ACP states.

              between promising political speeches and the lack of ‘real action’

              technical support and agri-tech resources.

              The founders would break the silos through a holistic investment
              approach. They built LadyAgri on three pillars to tackle the
              specific needs of women in agri-business with tailor made
              solutions to overcome systemic constraints, improve quality and
              market access. The founders’ ambition is to bring women out of the
              shadows where they are ‘visible’ and ‘valued’ at every step of the
              agri-value chain.

                  <p class="paragraph">
                    Hilary Barry is originally from Ireland. She is founder and
                    Secretary General of the LadyAgri Impact Investment Hub. Her
                    mindset in setting up ‘LadyAgri’ was that investing in women
                    is simply smart economics! She is an avid supporter of the
                    Africa-EU partnership, convinced that the future of the two
                    continents is intrinsically linked through strong trade
                    relations and inclusive agri-value chains. Since her first
                    experience in Ghana in 1993 she has dedicated her entire
                    career to social impact programmes across sub-saharan Africa
                    (public health, agriculture, water, social development, SME
                    support and women entrepreneurship). “By dedicating our
                    support to women, we can be guaranteed that we are also
                    investing in improving family livelihoods, improving
                    opportunities for the next generation, positively impacting
                    communities, creating decent jobs and prospects”. Along with
                    her co- founders, Hilary is a convinced venture
                    philanthropist and believes patient investment in women in
                    agri-supply chains, though challenging, will have a ‘rising
                    tide’ effect and wide social impact.<br />‍<br />Hilary is
                    an experienced manager and leads the LadyAgri team of
                    expertise dedicated to providing technical assistance,
                    access to financing and setting up B2B agribusiness, food
                    technology partnerships for women agri- entrepreneurs.
                    Hilary Barry has managed numerous development programmes
                    with the European institutions, the World Bank, FMO and led
                    multidisciplinary teams in Africa, the Caribbean and the
                    Pacific. Hilary is at ease working with both the private,
                    public and financial sectors where she has actively
                    supported companies and professional associations in
                    development of trade relations and secured investments to
                    strengthen business and exports. She holds a Master’s in
                    Science (MSc) Food Marketing, Rural Development and
                    Cooperative Organisation and BA European Political Science
                    from the National University of Ireland.<br />

                    Aida Axelsson-Bakri, of Ethiopian and Swiss origin, is a
                    co-Founder and Chair of the LadyAgri Strategy Advisory
                    Council. A social-entrepreneur at heart, Aida believes that
                    LadyAgri is the vehicle by which women agri- entrepreneurs
                    will finally be able to reach their potential and bring
                    quality, security, and jobs to Africa’s food systems.<br /><br />Aida
                    is Founder and Managing Director of a leading Brussels-based
                    consultancy, ADS Insight, she has a strong sense of
                    leadership and management in the field of International and
                    European affairs. Her expertise is in public affairs,
                    corporate social responsibility, international relations and
                    European Union policy and funding instruments. In the area
                    of food safety, agri-supply chains and nutrition, she
                    supports i.a. the African Union Commission notably in their
                    efforts to address the contamination of food by aflatoxin
                    through the Partnership for Aflatoxin Control in Africa
                    (PACA). She is passionate about the complex debate around
                    social investment – particularly in the area of
                    agri-business and women, and the methodologies that serve to
                    measure impact. In May 2019, Aïda Axelson Bakri shared the
                    LadyAgri story on TED X Talk and in November 2019 she was
                    identified as one of the 11 most successful international
                    women entrepreneurs by Vital Voices sponsored by Bank of
                    America, .Through her company, ADS Insight, she provided
                    LadyAgri with its initial “incubator” start up space and
                    continues to whole-heartedly support its cause. Aida has

                  </h1>
                  <p class="paragraph">
                    Ayélé Gabiam is of Togolese origin and co-founder of Lady
                    Agri Impact Investment Hub. She is the Director of
                    partnerships for LadyAgri. Being part of the African
                    diaspora, Ayélé is aware of the challenges faced by the
                    African continent and believes these can only be overcome by
                    the economic development and job-creation within SMEs
                    especially in the agricultural sector. For Ayélé, it is
                    important to especially invest in the potential of women
                    agri- entrepreneurs as they are the links that hold our
                    agri-value chains together. We must offer them the agri-
                    business know-how, technology and access to finance to grow.
                    She emphasises, “We African women need to regain confidence
                    in ourselves and our ability to run our own businesses and
                    contribute positively to our communities. Women are the
                    fabric that hold our nations together”.<br /><br />Ayélé is
                    a strong advocate of valuing local expertise and know-how
                    when providing technical assistance. Finding local solutions
                    to global problems is the first step towards sustainable
                    economic development.<br /><br />Specialised in ACP-EU
                    relations as a public relations expert, especially for
                    Interprofessional Associations and Export Agencies along
                    with the CAVIE (African Center for Business Intelligence and
                    Intelligence), she has organised several trade missions and
                    high level business meetings and conferences in West and
                    Central African countries, particularly in the agricultural
                    sector. Her experience on the ground allows her to have
                    excellent understanding of diplomatic and commercial
                    partnership relations with decision-makers from African and
                    European countries. Since 2015, she runs her own company,
                    which accompanies African trade missions to new markets
                    throughout Europe and the Caribbean. Ayélé holds a Degree in
                    Communications and Public Relations from the Free University
                    of Brussels (ULB) and speaks French, English and Ewe-Mina.
