              The AWE Impact Investment Hub is a network of International and
              African professionals supporting women agri-entrepreneurs in
              Africa and Small Island Developing States. We have experts across
              30 African countries. Our boots on the ground approach allows us
              to have our fingers on the pulse of market fluctuations and the
              reality faced by agri-entrepreneurs. We mobilise our experts
              quickly and efficiently and provide appropriate solutions for
              local agri-businesses. Our International experts work in tandem
              with our local experts ensuring we are at the cutting edge of
              market requirements, local, regional and global.

              All AWE entrepreneurs commit and comply with the AWE Social Impact
              Charter.Their commitment helps to protect and advance the
              socio-economic interests of women in their supply chain, their
              agri-businesses and communities. By committing to re-investing in
              the community, our projects contribute directly to i.a. health
              insurance schemes for women and education funds for girls. Through
              attentiveness to quality, their businesses help to ensure food

            <p class="paragraph cc-gray">
              Our primary beneficiaries are agri-businesses that are at least
              51% woman-owned, woman-led, and in an agri- value chain
              traditionally dominated by women producers.We also support gender
              smart agri-businesses who are not women led but want to include,
              value and strengthen women in their agri-supply chains as
              suppliers, employees or who want to grow their female
              agri-customer client base. Through our work under Pillar 1
              (coaching/mentoring) we help our agri-entrepreneurs to see the
              importance of social impact, climate-resilience, environmental
              protection, and strive for a circular economy in their
              resource-use. We ensure that our agri-businesses demonstrate ‘best
              practices’ and are in line with the fundamental principles of the
              EU ‘GREEN DEAL’ supported by the African Union. Under Pillar 3 we
              facilitate B2B linkages to buyers and agri-business suppliers
              creating virtuous trade relationships and technology sharing
              between the EU and African Union.

                Women entrepreneurs invest at home. Given the current migration
                crisis between rural and urban areas, between countries and at
                continental scale, investing in women who are traditionally less
                mobile than men naturally translate into a positive ‘rising
                tide’ for the whole community.

                Gender lens investment into projects targeting women triples
                impact. Improving womens’ access to agricultural training,
                agri-inputs, equipment, mechanisation improves women’s’ yields
                and farm revenue. When women’s revenue increases, school
                enrolment rises, family health and nutrition improve.

                Investing into women agri-entrepreneurs working at the

                When women led agri-MSME’s, cooperatives and women farmer groups
                thrive, communities thrive. Stronger participation of women
                agri-entrepreneurs in agri-producer representation strengthen
                women’s influence over decision making and local leadership
                dynamics.
